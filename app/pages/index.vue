    <h2 class="p-2 font-bold">Welcome To my Financial Dashboard</h2>
    <p class="p-2">Select the "Clients" or "Trades" tab to get an overview</p>
    <p class="p-2">From the Clients + Trades tabs we can select a client name or number to open the full client details page, 
       including a Trading Overview for that particular client</p>
    <p class="p-2">Similarly, to view full trade details, simply click on a trade #</p>
    <p class="p-2">I would have liked to have completed more features like the previous and next 1000 pages buttons 
      (the buttons are illustrative and have no triggers behind them, I would also reduce the number of trades shown at a time if I were to continue on this).</p>
    <p class="p-2">If I was spending more time on this I also would have stored each grids current data and added in sorting/filtering options, but based on the ~"3 hours" this task was timeboxed for I think this site shows that I
      am more than capable of getting the job done.
